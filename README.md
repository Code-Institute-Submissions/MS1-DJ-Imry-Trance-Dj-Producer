For the deployed site follow :

# **_Dj Imry - Trance Dj & Producer_**

This is my first Milestone Project for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Fullstack Web Developer Diploma. This project is design to demonstrate the skills I have gain from the User Centric Frontend Development module. With this project I want to demostrate my knoledge on using HTML and CSS languages.

## **_Purpose Of The Project_**

This project is design to showcase my own DJ brand with the use of picture and music links that I have made during my music carrier.

The main purpose of this project is to provide the users with infomation related to Dj Imry depending on the user needs.
I want fan to be able to check news, listeners to listen to my music and promoter to check my information and music to be valuated on regards of booking opportunity.

## **_UX_**

The web-site is design with a "Mobile-First" approach.

When reaching the home page you are welcomed with an high quality picture and 4 reviews from fans and professionals. The user friendly layout invite the user to view the biography page, music page and in the end a section for bookings and general enquires.

The web site is designed for three type of users. The listeners , the fans and the promoters. The users have different way to listen to my music and connect with social media.


### **_User Stories_**



* As a Listener, I want to be able to listen to Dj Imry's music by clicking to the "Listen" page, SoundCloud and YouTube Icons on the footer. The listener can come back to the web site to check for new music.

* As a Fan, I want to be able to access Dj Imry's music by clicking to the "Listen" page, SoundCloud and YouTube Icons on the footer, check social media post via social icons on the footer. The fan can come back to the web site to check news via social media icons and new music .

* As a Promoter, I want to check Imry's biography page, reviews from professionals, check social media and listening to Imry's music to consider future bookings. The promoter can come back to the web site to see the progression of my carrier via new reviews, listen to new music and check information on social media.

### **_Colors Scheme_**

The project was develop by keeping colors to a minimum. I took the inspiration by the color scheme used in the video project "Resume Project" Code Institute "User Centric Front End Development Project". 

I have used the following color throughout the web-site.

Nav bar and footer have background color (#23374c) which mark nicely the start and end of the page. 

The Navbar has the color (#676767) for the pages names when not active. When the page are view so they are active they become color (#fafafa) which contrast with the dark background color of the Navbar.

The Footer has the social media icons color (#fafafa) which contrast with the dark color of the background.

On the home page the background color for the Wecome text and testimonial part is color (#676767). 

Color (#676767) has been used in the Biography page as a background color. Where at the top I have used a black "Imry logo" and the writing describing the Biography is color (#fafafa) which give a nice contrast for an easy reading specially in small devices.

The color (#676767) has also been used for the background color of the Listen page . Here as well to keep the color scheme consistant I have used the color (#fafafa) for the section titles and for wording at the top of the page.

On the booking page the colors used are only for the button (#676767) and for the wording the color (#fafafa).


### **_Wireframe_**

For the Wireframes I have decided to design it by hand. There has been no alteration to Wireframes from the start of the project.

## **_Debugging_**

Durign the creation of the Booking page I had a problem with the ability to show the error message when the form wasn't completed correctly. The modal message would show even if the form wasn't completed in all its parts.
